# Algos repo

This is a collection of algos I work through while training. Included are solutions and tests in their own folder.

## Usage

If you would like to work on these problems yourself follow these steps:

- fork this repo
- clone your forked repo to your local machine
- cd into the `algos` folder and enter `npm install` in your terminal.
- use `npm run test` to run the tests

Each problem is contained in its own folder with the correlating prompt, solution, and test script. Go to the respective folder to alter the solutions and tests.
