# Two Number Sum

Create a function that will take an array of unique numbers and a number representing a target sum. If two numbers from the input array add up to equal the target sum, return those two numbers in an array, in any order. If there is no match, return an empty array. Note that a number from the array can not be added to itself to reach the target sum.
