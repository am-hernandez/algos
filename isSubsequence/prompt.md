# Subsequence

Create a function called `isSubsequence` that, when passed two arrays as arguments, will return `true` if the second argument is a valid subsequence of the first argument array and will otherwise return `false` if it is not a valid subsequence. A valid subsequence will match the array in the order of the elements but not necessarily in adjacency. Althugh the array may have more elements than the subsequence, it should contain all elements in the subsequence in the same order in order for this function to return `true`.
